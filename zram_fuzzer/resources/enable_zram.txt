How to enable zRAM
The zRAM module is controlled by systemd, so there's no need for an fstab entry. And since everything is already installed out of the box, we only need to create a few files and modify one. 

Open a terminal window and create a new file with the command:

sudo nano /etc/modules-load.d/zram.conf
In that file, add the word:

zram
Save and close the file. 

Next, create a second new file with the command:

sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/zram.conf
In that file, paste the line:

options zram num_devices=1
Save and close the file.

Next, we need to configure the size of the zRAM partition. Create a new file with the command:

sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-zram.rules
In that file, paste the following (modifying the disksize attribute to fit your needs):

KERNEL=="zram0", ATTR{disksize}="512M",TAG+="systemd"
Save and close the file.

How to disable traditional swap
In order for zRAM to function, you're going to need to disable the traditional swap. This is handled within the fstab file. Open that file with the command:

sudo nano /etc/fstab
In that file, comment out (add a leading # character) the line starting with /swap.img.

Save and close the file.

How to create a systemd unit file
In order for zRAM to run, we need to create a systemd unit file. Create this file with the command:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/zram.service
In that file, paste the following contents:

[Unit]
Description=Swap with zram
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot 
RemainAfterExit=true
ExecStartPre=/sbin/mkswap /dev/zram0
ExecStart=/sbin/swapon /dev/zram0
ExecStop=/sbin/swapoff /dev/zram0

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Save and close the file. 

Enable the new unit with the command:

sudo systemctl enable zram
Reboot the machine.

How to find out if zRAM is working
Once the system reboots, log back in. From a terminal window, issue the command:

cat /proc/swaps
You should now see that /dev/zram0 is handling your swap (Figure A).
